Sarah Palin To Become The Vice President Running Mate For The 2nd Time
In a recent interview, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin commented that she isn’t ruling out the possibility of becoming a vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump. Still, she expressed concerns that her position on the campaign trail could do more harm than good.
When asked about the issue on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Palin called herself a ‘realist’ and acknowledged that a run for office would bring a ton of controversy.
“Well, I want to help and not hurt, and I am such a realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who would say ‘anybody but Palin,’” the former GOP vice presidential nominee commented.
“So, you know, I just – I just want the guy to win,” she added. “I want American to win. And I don’t know if I would be the person that would be able to help him win, Jake.”
Palin did point out, however, that Palin has already had her background investigated ruthlessly.
“I think I’m pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country,” Palin commented. “So, I think there are so many other great people out there in America who can serve in this position. I think if someone wanted to choose me, they already know who I am, what I stand for. They wouldn’t be in for any surprises.”
Palin would be a controversial pick, there is no doubt, but Trump could do a lot worse. She served John McCain well in his 2008 campaign for president.
Palin has an energy that could match Trump’s on the trail, and there is no question that she is a tried and true conservative.
What do you think of Palin? Would she make a good Vice President?
