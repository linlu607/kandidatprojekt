BREAKING: Another Clinton Associate Set To Testify Against Hillary Found Dead
Americans have trouble trusting the Clintons for many reasons, but near the top of the list is the infamous “Clinton kill list,” featuring the names of people close to Hillary and Bill that have died under mysterious circumstances.
Now, it appears that yet another name has been added to this list.
Former U.N. President John Ashe was reportedly found dead last Wednesday. Officials claim he died of a heart attack, but others suspect foul play. The Conservative Tribune reports that local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York argue that Ashe died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.
Ashe’s death became even more suspicious when police learned that he was scheduled to be in court Monday with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng. Ashe reportedly received $1 billion in donations from Seng during his term as president.
It was later revealed that Seng also illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee during Bill’s presidency. An anonymous source told reporters that prosecutors planned to use this link to Ashe to convince him to testify against her.
“It would have been very embarrassing,” the source added. “His death was conveniently timed.”
Of course, conspiracy theorists believe that Ashe is just the latest victim of the Clintons. We wouldn’t put it past them to take down anyone who has damning information against them—and God only knows how long that list is.
What do you think? Do the Clintons belong behind bars and far, far away from the White House?
