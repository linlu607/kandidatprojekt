Hey Hillary, thanks for telling the world America’s response time for a nuclear launch

There’s no telling how many times during the campaign Hillary Clinton has brought up America’s nuclear codes, and how important it is that someone who’s riled by a tweet never be allowed anywhere near them.
She also repeated on #DebateNight the established Democrat talking point that the contents of the documents posted by WikiLeaks aren’t nearly as important as the fact that Russia is hacking our servers — a threat so severe that she decided to set up her own private email server in her house.
It’s fine, though: she assured the public that just because she didn’t know what the (C) on her emails indicated, it didn’t matter as she treated everything as if it were at the highest level of classification … well, just about everything.
No one caught that Crooked Hillary stated on LIVE TV what our NUKE RESPONSE TIME IS 4 MIN??@FoxNews @DRUDGE #debatenight #ChrisWallace pic.twitter.com/QBbbmGkmeL
What, is that important? Turns out a whole lot of people caught it, most likely including the people behind the hacking of America’s servers.
Did Hillary just leak TS information on national TV regarding nuclear response time? #debatenight
#DebateNight Did Hillary just tell the entire world what our nuclear response time is? WHAT THE ACTUAL F**K!?!?!?

What's the chance Chelsea Clinton will thank 'Trump's henchmen' in ICE for this arrest?
Hillary dropped, on live #debatenight, Response time between presidential order and nuclear missile launch. Info isis classified TS/NC2.
Hillary disclosed classified information tonight. HIGHLY classified information. Our nuclear response time is top secret.
First it was Vice President Joe Biden who, while campaigning for Hillary, thought he’d point out exactly who in his entourage was carrying the nuclear codes with him, so it was thoughtful of her to complete the gift set to the country’s enemies. But like President Obama said, “there’s classified, and then there’s classified.” Anyone could basically get this info “open source.”
Good thing Hillary told everyone about our nuclear response time. Yet another military strategy given to everyone 😑
It was an honest mistake; surely they’d let it slide if someone in the military did the same thing.
Why did hillary give away nuclear response time on international television? Let me guess "she didn't know it was classified" #DebateNight
Was the nuclear response time of "4 minutes with an inability to cancel" that Hillary mentioned tonight classified by any chance? #debate
'How is that not classified?': Apparently Hillary Clinton had emails to President Obama on her private server https://t.co/QJsMe8TJWC
