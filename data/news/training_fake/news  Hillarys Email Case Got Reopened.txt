Hillary’s Email Case Got Reopened And James Comey Asked For Immunity. Trey Gowdy Says Hell No.
Here we go again, but this time it could be the end for both Hillary Clinton and FBI Director James Comey.
As you’re about to see below James Comey, the current FBI director that let Hillary off the hook for her CLEAR violation of many laws with her email scandal, has now asked for immunity from congress for his involvement in the scandal and the subsequent findings. What what!? Immunity?
That’s right. What Comey is asking for is to be absolved of what he’s done and anything that may happen in the future from any further investigations. How does that not throw up the biggest red flag in American history?!
Well it did to Trey Gowdy and he just ripped Comey a new one and is about to do everything in his power to stop that immunity from happening!
What happens next is anybody’s guess, but we’re assuming Gowdy will do everything in his power to bring James Comey to justice.
And in turn, that means he’ll be bringing Hillary Clinton to justice as well because if the head of the FBI is asking for immunity, you can be damn sure that the grand architect of this entire fiasco will be going down with her.
Spread the word and support Gowdy as he takes her and Comey down!
