The world reacts to Trump’s Syria missile strikes – video report
Donald Trump announced on Thursday evening that he launched a missile attack against Syria, targeting the airbase where he said the chemical attack that killed dozens of people was launched. The Syrian army and Russia condemned the strikes, while the UK, along with other US allies, supported the decision. China did not explicitly condemn the US, but said they were opposed to the use of force, even though they are against the use of chemical weapons. Chinese president Xi Jinping is currently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Florida estate
