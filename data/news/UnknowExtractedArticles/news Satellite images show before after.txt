Jeff Davis. "[They] targeted aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems, and radars."Satellite imagery provided by ImageSat International reveals the extent of that damage, in comparison to previous records. It was not clear Friday how soon after the strikes the images were recorded.Two hardened aircraft hangars on the airfield's east shows holes in their roofs, with what appears to be charring and debris spraying out of them. Two apparent impact craters are near one of the hangars. The third in the group is completely obliterated, as is the building directly next to it.Read More
ImageSat International, a company that operates high-resolution satellites, notes five "workshops" that appear to be hit on the airfield's western edge, just north of ammunition sites.
A bunker on base is all but wiped out; the buildings appearing to be blown away.
Two US senior military officials told CNN's Barbara Starr about 20 planes were destroyed in the hail of missiles early Friday.
A U.S. defense official told CNN's Ryan Browne that 58 out of 59 of the Tomahawk missiles, "severely degraded or destroyed" their intended targets.Sections45CongressSecurityThe NineTrumpmericaFollow usCNN.com© 2017 Cable News Network.
