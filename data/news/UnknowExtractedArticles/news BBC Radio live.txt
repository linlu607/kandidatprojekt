Mark Chapman brings you an N'Golo Kanté special, alongside French football writer Julian Laurens, The Sunday Times correspondent Jonathan Northcroft and Paul McGuinnes, who was until last year the Under-18s coach at Manchester United. We'll take you on N'Golo Kanté's journey to the top and explain what makes him so special. Why did he go to training on a scooter? And what are Premier League academies doing to unearth the next Kanté?
