Freida Pinto on why Guerrilla is ‘timely’ Freida Pinto shot to fame in the film Slumdog Millionaire and became one of India's highest profile actors overnight. She's soon to be on our TV screens in Sky Atlantic's, Guerrilla. She plays Jas, an activist, who forms a radical underground cell. Set in 1971, it poses the question: what if the original Black Power movement in London had used violence? Freida talks to Jenni about why the subject matter is still relevant today, the reason they cast an Asian woman as the lead and she recalls a time when she was 12-years-old where she used her voice to stand up for what she believed in.
