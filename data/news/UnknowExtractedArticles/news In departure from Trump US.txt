So that's my job but I look at it from a strategic perspective and I can't see a solution that doesn't involve China.""China is the definition of North Korea's backyard," Hyten told the committee, saying that the close economic links between Pyongyang and Beijing made China a pivotal player in curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions.How could Trump go it alone on North Korea?"It's hard for me to see a solution without China," he added. Trump will host Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and the issue of North Korea's nuclear program is bound to be on the agenda.Asked by the Sen. Jim Inhofe what he thought constituted the greatest nuclear threat to the US, Hyten pointed to both Russia and North Korea."I think Russia is the greatest threat. What I'm concerned about most nights is North Korea," he said, citing the latter's unpredictability. "Every time they launch I'm not sure what that launch is going to be. That would be the definition of unpredictable."Sections45CongressSecurityThe NineTrumpmericaFollow usCNN.com© 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
