Mahlum told police that Brown learned the Heimlich maneuver during the training her received in a youth police training program.
"Brown learned the Heimlich maneuver as part of his first aid training as a Police Explorer with the City of La Crosse Police Department," a post from the police department's Facebook page read.
According to La Crosse police, the Police Explorer program offers young adults "a personal awareness of the criminal justice system through training, practical experiences, competition, and other activities."
The freshman's quick thinking and calm under pressure have people praising him on Facebook.
"Thank you for staying calm and knowing exactly what to do!" one woman commented on the School District of La Crosse video. "You are a hero!"
