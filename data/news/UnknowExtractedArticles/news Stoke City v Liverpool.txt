Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana were both on target when Liverpool beat Stoke 4-1 in DecemberTEAM NEWSStoke are hopeful Jon Walters will be available despite missing the defeat at Burnley with concussion.Marc Muniesa and Mame Diouf suffered midweek knocks but may be fit, while Xherdan Shaqiri has trained and is "an option", manager Mark Hughes says.Liverpool will assess playmaker Philippe Coutinho, who was forced off against Bournemouth due to illness and missed training on Thursday and Friday.
Sadio Mane requires knee surgery and will miss the rest of the season.Joel Matip should return to the starting line-up after a back problem reduced him to the role of substitute in midweek.MOTD COMMENTATOR'S NOTESGuy Mowbray: "It's hard to know who to make favourites. "Stoke? Much stronger at home, and unburdened by immediate relegation pressure."BUT…..three defeats in a row and one win from six is troubling form. They're not (mathematically) safe yet and perhaps need to engineer a sense of tension."Liverpool? Five games unbeaten and one defeat in seven - plus the other three teams in the top four have all won at Stoke this season."BUT….all five league defeats have come against sides currently in the bottom half, and their recent away form borders on rotten. "Those still going for an away win might pair it with Definitly Red for the Grand National. Me? I'm sticking a pin in for both."Twitter: @GuymowbrayWHAT THE MANAGERS SAYStoke manager Mark Hughes: "With the quality of opposition we have been up against in the last couple of weeks, you can argue this run of fixtures has been the most difficult we've had this season."Apart from Leicester, where I was disappointed with our performance, we've had decent-enough performances. That continued against Burnley because I felt we were the better team on the night."The way we view the season as a whole helps us because the focus is on the next game and the next series of fixtures. We set realistic goals throughout the season and move on to the next one."Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on the current injury and illness toll: "It compromises our situation and makes like not easy. "These are the highest-quality players and if you took out all the players which we miss now from other teams I'd be surprised if they could play their best football."We don't play them (the top six) any more so we don't have influence on their games but I don't think 65 points will be enough to go to Champions League so we need to collect a few more points."But at this moment it is only how we can make a line-up against Stoke - and that is a real challenge."LAWRO'S PREDICTIONWhen you are ahead with a few minutes to go, you make sure you win. Liverpool do not have the ability to do that at the moment. You could argue they are too nice, and they are also missing the injured Adam Lallana and Sadio Mane.Stoke have now lost three on the spin and have scored only one goal in their past four matches, but I don't see Liverpool going there and winning.Prediction: 1-1Lawro's full predictions v singer Amy MacdonaldThink you can do better than Lawro?
