An excavation team in Egypt has found what appears to be the interior of a buried pyramid dating back 3,700 years to the 13th dynasty. The antiquities ministry says that both a corridor and a block engraved with 10 lines of hieroglyphics are in good condition, reports the BBC, and the team will continue digging in an attempt to estimate its size and glean whatever other details they can.
So far they've unearthed not only the interior corridor that leads to the inside of the pyramid but a hall that extends to a southern ramp, as well as a room to the west, reports Ahram Online.
The structure was found near the Dahshur royal necropolis 25 miles south of Cairo, where King Sneferu built the Bent Pyramid, whose angle changes halfway up, and the Red Pyramid, Egypt's first smooth-sided pyramid, some 4,600 years ago, reports the AP.
His son Khufu went on to build the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The most recent discovery lies north of the Bent Pyramid and is estimated to have been built about 1,000 years after Sneferu and Khufu's time.
