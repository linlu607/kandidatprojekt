Russian warship steams toward US destroyers that launched Syria strikes | Fox News
A Russian warship has entered the eastern Mediterranean Sea Friday and is heading toward the two U.S. Navy destroyers that launched missile strikes into Syria, Fox News has learned.
The Russian frigate, Admiral Grigorovich RFS-494, crossed through the Bosphorus Strait “a few hours ago” from the Black Sea, according to a U.S. defense official.
The Russian warship is now steaming in the direction of the U.S. warships.
Also Friday, one of the American destroyers that launched the missiles into Syria started heading to an undisclosed location to rearm.
The U.S. struck a Syrian airbase in retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians, including infants and small children, military officials said.
The frigate was bound for the Syrian port of Tartus on a routine voyage, the Russian news agency TASS reported Friday, citing a military-diplomatic source.
"The Russian ship armed with cruise missiles Kalibr will visit the logistics base in Tartus, Syria," the source said.
The ship was near the Black Sea straits, Tass reported. It left on a voyage after stopping at Novorossiisk for supplies and taking part in a joint exercise with Turkish ships in the Black Sea.
