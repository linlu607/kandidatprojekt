“There’s two big pieces that you feel when you see something like that,” Ellison told the station. “You’re sad, and you’re mad. There's not a lot that you can do about either one of them. So I came home and put another flag up.”
Ellison reported the vandalism to Phoenix police, who were investigating, the station reported.
Lisa Ellison told KTVK-TV that the look on her husband after he found the flag in the driveway was “like somebody shot him.”
“He just was devastated that somebody would do this,” she said.
Ellison and his wife live in a quiet neighborhood, according to KPNX.
“The flag means everything to me,” Ellison told the station. “When you say your oath and you join the military you stand in front of that flag when you raise your right hand. When we lose a service member or a veteran dies we put it on the casket.”
