(CNN)President Donald Trump tracked the first major military operation of his presidency from a makeshift Situation Room on the grounds of his lavish Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, surrounded by grim-faced aides fresh from dinner in the club's dining room.That's according to a photo of the proceedings released by the White House Friday.Who's who in the Trump White HouseThe image, which Press Secretary Sean Spicer said was edited for security reasons, shows Trump hunched over a table kitted out with secure video equipment and briefing papers. His brow furrowed, Trump is flanked by his Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce.Spicer tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary James Mattis, and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, were not in the room, but instead participating by secure video conference.WH photo (ed for security): @potus receives briefing on #syria military strike fr Nat Security team, inc @vp , SECDEF, CJCS via secure VTC pic.twitter.com/aaCnR7xomR— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017
The president's press secretary said the photo was taken around 9:15 p.m. ET on Thursday evening, after Trump's dinner with visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping.Read MoreThe image stood in stark contrast to a previous weekend at Mar-a-Lago, which saw Trump plot out a response to a North Korean missile test from his club's patio. That session played out in full view of other diners, drawing criticism.This time -- and with far more sensitive information at play -- Trump retreated behind closed doors.Photo taken, after strike, approximately 9:15pm ET on Thursday April 6, 2017 in SCIF at Mar-a-Lago https://t.co/PlEsbjIcxy— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017

Joseph Dunford, who participated via secure teleconference from Washington, Spicer said. Where was the photo taken?At a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort Trump frequents, according to Spicer. What does the photo evoke?The famous photo of Obama administration officials watching the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. Material on the table was blurred before the photo's release.The photo has already been likened to the iconic picture of former President Barack Obama huddled with his national security team in the White House Situation Room as they monitor via live video the killing of Osama bin Laden. The picture is shot from the same angle, with the president receiving a briefing on the operation he just ordered. Does Kushner have security clearance? Trump considers rearranging the seats at his tableKushner has yet to detail to the federal government all of his foreign contacts, a condition of receiving his top secret security clearance. Most people in the photo appear to be looking at a screen on the table, but Kushner is looking resolutely over the table. It's not clear if he's looking at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or beyond, to White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this reportSections45CongressSecurityThe NineTrumpmericaFollow usCNN.com© 2017 Cable News Network.
