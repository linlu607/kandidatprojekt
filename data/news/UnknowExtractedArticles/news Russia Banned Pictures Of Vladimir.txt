Russia Banned Pictures Of Vladimir Putin In Drag, So 'The Late Show' Made This
Any person in Russia caught sharing this video could face time in prison.
The Russian government made it illegal this week to distribute or share any images similar to that meme of President Vladimir Putin wearing heavy makeup, deeming it “extremist” material.
Any person in Russia who violates that ban could face a fine or time in prison.
Naturally, Stephen Colbert saw the ban as a challenge and helped create the wonderful video above for “The Late Show.”
“Because this is America, for now, and we can do anything we want,” Colbert said in the video posted Friday, “‘The Late Show’ has put together our own artistic interpretation of Vladimir Putin.”
The TV host even offered the Russian president a new title: “Gay Icon.”
Don’t be the last to watch the viral video everyone is talking about.
