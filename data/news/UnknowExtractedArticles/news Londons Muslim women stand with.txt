Investigators: No direct ISIS linkInvestigators do not currently see a direct ISIS hand in the attack, a British counterterrorism official said earlier in the weekend. JUST WATCHEDNeighbors describe London attackerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNeighbors describe London attacker 02:29Khalid Masood was active on the encryption messaging service WhatsApp two minutes before he started his attack on Westminster Bridge, but no evidence has emerged to show he was communicating with ISIS at any point, the official told CNN. Investigators are looking into communications he had with individuals leading up to the attack, the official added.
But investigators currently believe Masood was more likely inspired by ISIS rather than directed by the terrorist group, the official told CNN. Investigators are still assessing whether the attacker plotted alone or acted as part of a broader conspiracy. They're continuing to probe his contacts in radical circles in Birmingham, Luton and London, the official told CNN. Investigation underwayAuthorities are also investigating how Masood, who used multiple aliases, became radicalized. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao but also used the name Adrian Elms, police said Friday. Britain's most senior counterterrorism police officer, Mark Rowley, said: "Clearly that's the main line of our investigation -- is what led him to be radicalized. Was it through influences in a community, influences from overseas or through online propaganda?"He appealed for anyone who knew Masood well or was aware of his recent movements to get in touch with authorities. Born in Kent, Masood had previous convictions, including some for violent offenses, but none for terrorism, police said. His most recent conviction was in 2003 for possession of a knife.JUST WATCHEDLondon Attack: An animated mapReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLondon Attack: An animated map 00:55Did London attack expose city's 'weak spot'?Attack victimsVictims, from left, American tourist Kurt Cochran, teacher Aysha Frade and police Officer Keith Palmer.
