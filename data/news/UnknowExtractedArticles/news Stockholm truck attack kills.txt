"We
are thinking about the victims -- their families and friends -- and those who were injured," he said.The Prime Minister returned to the capital from the west of the country, his spokesman Erik Nises told CNN."We will always do everything we can to protect Sweden, but we can't guarantee that it won't happen again," Lofven told reporters later Friday."If this is a terrorist attack, terrorists ... want us to not live our lives normally," he said. "But that is what we are going to do. So terrorists can never defeat Sweden. Never." King Carl XVI Gustaf announced he had cut short his state visit to Brazil to return home immediately in the aftermath of the attack.Police say they want to speak to this man about the attack.'He put his foot on the gas'According to eyewitness Veronica Durango, the driver "put his foot on the gas and ran through the crowd.""He came from Olof Palmes Street and drove down to Drottninggatan," Durango told CNN in a phone interview."It was like he was driving through paper. It's like it was nothing.
I can't even believe how a person could do such a thing.
And then he just kept on going. I was in shock."
Spendrups Brewery, which owns the truck used in the attack, said the vehicle was "hijacked" by a "masked man" shortly before 3 p.m. local time. Spokeswoman Rose-Marie Hertzman told CNN that the company's driver attempted to chase after the truck but was nearly run over."Plenty of people have been injured and some have died in the attack that just hit Stockholm," said Nina Odermalm Schei, head of press for the security service."We are still trying to determine who the attacker was, if the attack was carried by one or more people, and the number of injured."

Taxis circled the area for fares but no one was around. It was an unusual scene: Normally, central Stockholm would be bustling with residents ready to enjoy the weekend. The only people here were the investigators and the pack of journalists held behind the blue police tape.A cordon remained in place around the crash site; the back of the truck was visible -- still wedged in the building. On a chilly night, bundled-up firefighters and heavily armed officers were on scene, along with two tow trucks that were preparing to remove the hijacked vehicle.
The immediate vicinity around the crash site in Stockholm was empty tonight. Several police vans, firefighters and heavily armed officers were still at the scene as well as two tow trucks which were preparing to remove the hijacked vehicle from the department store's front window.
