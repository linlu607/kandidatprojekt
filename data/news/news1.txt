Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), formerly Theater High Altitude Area Defense, is a United States Army anti-ballistic missile system which is designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill approach.[2] THAAD was developed to counter Iraq's Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991.[3] The missile carries no warhead, but relies on the kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional warhead ballistic missiles, and nuclear tipped ballistic missiles will not detonate upon a kinetic energy hit.[N 1]
Originally a US Army program, THAAD has come under the umbrella of the Missile Defense Agency. The Navy has a similar program, the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which now has a land component as well ("Aegis ashore"). THAAD was originally scheduled for deployment in 2012, but initial deployment took place in May 2008.[4][5] THAAD has been deployed in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and South Korea.
The THAAD system is being designed, built, and integrated by Lockheed Martin Space Systems acting as prime contractor. Key subcontractors include Raytheon, Boeing, Aerojet, Rocketdyne, Honeywell, BAE Systems, Oshkosh Defense, MiltonCAT and the Oliver Capital Consortium.[6]

Development[edit]
THAAD missile diagram
The THAAD missile defense concept was proposed in 1987, with a formal request for proposals submitted to industry in 1991. In September 1992, the US Army selected Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) as prime contractor for THAAD development. Prior to development of a physical prototype, the Aero-Optical Effect (AOE) software code was developed to validate the intended operational profile of Lockheed's proposed design. The first THAAD flight test occurred in April 1995, with all flight tests in the Demonstration-Validation (DEM-VAL) program phase occurring at White Sands Missile Range. The first six intercept attempts missed the target (Flights 4–9). The first successful intercepts were conducted on 10 June 1999, and 2 August 1999, against Hera missiles.

Engineering and manufacturing[edit]
In June 2000, Lockheed won the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to turn the design into a mobile tactical army fire unit. Flight tests of this system resumed with missile characterization and full system tests in 2006 at White Sands Missile Range, then moved to the Pacific Missile Range Facility. The Interceptor was lead through development and initial production by Tory Bruno, who later became CEO of United Launch Alliance.

24 October 2012
Success
FTI-01 (Flight Test Integrated 01): test of the integration of THAAD with PAC-3 and Aegis against a raid of 5 missiles of different types.[17] During this engagement THAAD successfully intercepted an Extended Long Range Air Launch Target (E-LRALT) missile dropped from a C-17 north of Wake Island.[18] This marked the first time THAAD had intercepted a Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM).[18] Two AN/TPY-2 were used in the $180m test, with the forward-based radar feeding data into Aegis and Patriot systems as well as THAAD.[19]
THAAD-ER[edit]
Lockheed is pushing for funding for the development of an extended range (ER) version of the THAAD to counter maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low and high-altitude missile defenses. The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current 14.5 in (37 cm)-diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a 21 in (53 cm) first stage for greater range with a second "kick stage" to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of early 2015 THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries.[20] If funding for the THAAD-ER begins in 2018, a system could be produced by 2022 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense; these are expected to become available in the mid to late 2020's.[21]
Production and deployment[edit]
The AN/TPY-2 radar
Sometimes called Kinetic Kill technology, the THAAD missile destroys missiles by colliding with them, using hit-to-kill technology, like the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3 (although the PAC-3 also contains a small explosive warhead). This is unlike the Patriot PAC-2 which carried only an explosive warhead detonated using a proximity fuse. Although the actual figures are classified, THAAD missiles have an estimated range of 125 miles (200 km), and can reach an altitude of 93 miles (150 km). A THAAD battery consists of at least six[22] launcher vehicles, each equipped with eight missiles, with two mobile tactical operations centers (TOCs) and the AN/TPY-2 ground-based radar (GBR);[23] the U.S. Army plans to field at least six THAAD batteries.[20]
The THAAD missile is manufactured at the Lockheed Martin facility near Troy, Alabama. The facility performs final integration, assembly and testing of the THAAD missile. The THAAD Radar is an X Band active electronically scanned array Radar developed and built by Raytheon at its Andover, Massachusetts Integrated Air Defense Facility. It is the world's largest ground/air-transportable X-Band radar. The THAAD Radar and a variant developed as a forward sensor for ICBM missile defense, the Forward-Based X-Band – Transportable (FBX-T) radar was assigned a common designator, AN/TPY-2,[24] in late 2006/ early 2007.
First units activated[edit]
On 28 May 2008, the U.S. Army activated Alpha Battery, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-4),[25] 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas. Battery A-4 is part of the 32nd Army Air & Missile Defense Command. At the time, the battery had 24 THAAD interceptors, three THAAD launchers based on the M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System, a THAAD Fire Control and a THAAD radar. Full fielding began in 2009.[26][27] On 16 October 2009, the U.S. Army and the Missile Defense Agency activated the second Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Battery, Alpha Battery, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-2), at Fort Bliss.[28]
On 15 August 2012, Lockheed received a $150 million contract from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to produce THAAD Weapon System launchers and fire control and communications equipment for the U.S. Army. The contract included 12 launchers, two fire control and communications units, and support equipment. The contract provided six launchers for THAAD Battery 5 and an additional three launchers each to Batteries 1 and 2. These deliveries will bring all Batteries to the standard six launcher configuration.[29]
Deployments and orders[edit]
THAAD Energy Management Steering maneuver, used to burn excess propellant
In June 2009, the United States deployed a THAAD unit to Hawaii, along with the SBX sea-based radar, to defend against a possible North Korean launch targeting the archipelago.[30] In April 2013, the United States declared that Alpha Battery, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-4), would be deployed to Guam to defend against a possible North Korean IRBM attack targeting the island.[31][32] In March 2014 Alpha Battery, 2nd ADA RGT (A-2), did a change of responsibility with A-4 and took over the Defense of Guam Mission. After a successful 12-month deployment by A-4, Delta 2 (D-2) took its place for a 12-month deployment.
The United Arab Emirates signed a deal to purchase the missile defense system on 25 December 2011.[33] United Arab Emirates (UAE) has graduated its first two Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) unit classes at Fort Bliss in 2015, and in 2016.[34] Its first live-fire exercises with Patriot missiles took place in 2014.
On 27 May 2013, Oman announced a deal for the acquisition of the THAAD air defense system.[35] The U.S. AN/TPY-2 early missile warning radar station on Mt. Keren in the Negev desert is the only active foreign military installation in Israel.[36] According to U.S. officials the AN/TPY-2 radar was deployed at Turkey's Kürecik Air Force base.[37] The radar was activated at January 2012.[38]
On 1 November 2015, a THAAD system was a key component of Campaign Fierce Sentry Flight Test Operational-02 Event 2 (FTO-02 E2), a complex $230 million U.S. military missile defense system test event conducted at Wake Island and the surrounding ocean areas.[39] The objective was to test the ability of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and THAAD Weapon Systems to defeat a raid of three near-simultaneous air and missile targets, consisting of one medium-range ballistic missile, one short-range ballistic missile and one cruise missile target. During the test, a THAAD system on Wake Island detected and destroyed a short-range target simulating a short-range ballistic missile[39]:intercepts @1:13 & 3:12 that was launched by parachute ejected from a C-17 transport plane. At the same time, the THAAD system and the USS John Paul Jones guided missile destroyer both launched missiles to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile,[39]:intercepts @2:50 & 3:12 launched by parachute from a second C-17.[40][41] By March 2016, Army Space and Missile Defense Command was considering THAAD deployments to Europe with EUCOM and the Middle East with CENTCOM.[42]
Due to the threat of a military invasion by the People's Republic of China (PRC) of the democratic island country of the Republic of China (Taiwan), the President of Taiwan is undergoing negotiations with the United States to purchase the THAAD missile defense system to protect from the threat of over 2,000 Chinese short–range missiles.[43][44] that are currently aimed at Taiwan.[45][46][47]
Korean peninsula[edit]

On 17 October 2013, the South Korean military asked the Pentagon to provide information on the THAAD system concerning prices and capabilities as part of efforts to strengthen defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles.[48] However, South Korea decided it will develop its own indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile instead of buying the THAAD.[49] South Korean Defense Ministry officials previously requested information on the THAAD, as well as other missile interceptors like the Israeli Arrow 3, with the intention of researching systems for domestic technology development rather than for purchase. Officials did however state that American deployment of the THAAD system would help in countering North Korean missile threats.[50] Later South Korea announced it would be deploying THAAD by the end of 2017.[51]
In May 2014, the Pentagon revealed it was studying sites to base THAAD batteries in South Korea.[52] In November 2015, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said he would consider the U.S. deploying the THAAD in Japan to counter the threat of North Korean ballistic missiles.[53] In February 2016, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed concerns that deployment of THAAD in South Korea, despite being directed at North Korea, could jeopardize China's "legitimate national security interests."[54] The major controversy among Chinese officials is that they believe the purpose of the THAAD system, "which detects and intercepts incoming missiles at high altitudes, is actually to track missiles launched from China" not from North Korea.[55]
In July 2016, American and South Korean military officials agreed to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in the country to counter North Korea's growing threats and use of ballistic missile and nuclear tests; each THAAD unit consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, a fire control and communications unit, and an AN/TPY-2 radar.[56] Seongju County in North Gyeongsang Province was chosen as the site to base the THAAD, partly because it is out of range of North Korean rocket artillery along the DMZ,[57] which sparked protests from Seongju County residents from fear of the radiation emitted by the AN/TPY-2 radar.[58] On 30 September 2016, the U.S. and South Korea announced that THAAD would be relocated within the county, farther from the town's main residential areas and higher in elevation, to alleviate concerns.[59] By October 2016, Japan was considering procuring either THAAD or Aegis Ashore to add a new missile defense layer.[60]
On March 6, 2017, two THAAD launcher trucks arrived by air transport at Osan Air Base South Korea;[61][62] earlier that day, North Korea had launched 4 missiles.[63] Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., United States Pacific commander, issued a statement on the deployment of the system.[64] An article in Reuters noted that even with the THAAD defense system, a North Korean missile barrage would still pose a threat to South Korea[65] while an article in the International Journal of Space Politics & Policy said that South Korean forces already possess Patriot systems for point defense and Aegis destroyers capable of stopping ballistic missiles that may come from the north.[66][page needed][original research?]

Footnotes[edit]
^ The different kinds (e.g., nuclear, thermonuclear, conventional, chemical, biological) of warheads detonate in different ways, depending on their respective kind.
A high-altitude (occurring at over 100,000 feet) burst would have different effects than that from another kind of warhead.
A single modern nuclear weapon is more powerful than the entire weaponry of World War 2 combined; the principle for detonating a nuclear or thermonuclear weapon thus differs fundamentally from those of the other kinds of weapons.
The current signatories to the nuclear arms agreements employ failsafes in their nuclear weapons.
