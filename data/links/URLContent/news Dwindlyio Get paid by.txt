Dwindly.io is a URL shortener that pays a share of its advertising revenue to its users who bring traffic to their shortened URLs. Long story short, Dwindly allows its users to get paid whenever people click on their shortened URLs.
We pay for ALL legitimate visitors you bring to your links counting multiple views from the same viewers.
The sky is the limit. The earnings are proportional to your amount of traffic. The better your strategy to bring visitors is, the higher your income will be. The earnings potential depends on the amount of traffic you are capable of generating through your dwindled URLs.
We strive to get the best rates for your traffic in order to maximise your profits. We also provide a referral system, meaning that for every user that you refer to Dwindly.io, we will pay you 20% of their total income. Your referral will still earn the original 100% so he is not affected.
The best thing is its free for EVERYONE. On the contrary, you are the one that will be getting paid a share of the advertising revenue.
