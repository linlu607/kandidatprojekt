The display measures in at 6.01-inches and adopts the use of a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution. In addition, the OnePlus 5T comes equipped with a minimum of 6GB RAM, a minimum of 64GB storage, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Cameras include a dual rear setup (consisting of 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel cameras), along with a 16-megapixel front-facing camera. Addition features include a fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C connectivity, and a 3,300 mAh capacity battery – along with support for the company’s popular fast charging solution, Dash Charge.
