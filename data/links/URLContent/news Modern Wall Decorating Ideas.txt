An overview of strategies for adding style to a flat surface, the ideas below represent the quick and easy, as well as the more involved. Regardless of which path you choose, thinking outside of the box will do wonders. Don’t be afraid to get creative! Check out the wall decorating ideas that follow and let them inspire your next modern design project…Create an Interesting DisplayYou don’t have to tackle a major decorating project to bring some excitement to your walls. One strategy to consider: hanging decor that makes a big impact. For example, modern shelving can make a big impact on a plain wall, especially when it comes to sleek modern shelving in a variety of colors:Artfully arranged shelving can add interestSometimes it’s all in how you hang it.
