If you’re searching for ways to jazz up a wall or two at home, today’s post is for you. An overview of strategies for adding style to a flat surface, the ideas below represent the quick and easy, as well as the more involved. Regardless of which path you choose, thinking outside of the box will do wonders. Don’t be afraid to get creative! Check out the wall decorating ideas that follow and let them inspire your next modern design project…Create an Interesting DisplayYou don’t have to tackle a major decorating project to bring some excitement to your walls. One strategy to consider: hanging decor that makes a big impact. For example, modern shelving can make a big impact on a plain wall, especially when it comes to sleek modern shelving in a variety of colors:Artfully arranged shelving can add interestSometimes it’s all in how you hang it. For example, instead of opting for the typical gallery wall of art, try overlapping and layering canvases, combining them with lighting and other interesting flourishes.Combine a variety of elements for an accent wallA wall hanging is an easy way to make a big decorative statement.

The copper tone of the mirror frame below beautifully coordinates with the coppery throw pillows, creating a neutral space that’s anything but boring.Geo mirror with copper trimDon’t forget that an entire wall of mirrors will add instant elegance and do wonders for giving your home a spacious feel.
