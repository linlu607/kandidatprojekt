Beirut's moody nightspot 2 WEEKS coalesces industrial with luxury in an immersive experience for the city's club-goers...
Set over a single level, Beirut‚Äôs hedonists and trendsetters are descending upon new nightclub 2 WEEKS, as light, materiality, and a moody visual language coalesce to create an experiential experience for club-goers.
Located in Biel, overlooking the city‚Äôs sea port, Rabih Geha Architects created a webbed black steel shell to house a bar, DJ booth, and seating areas. Containing a large part of the club, this shell, a ‚Äòshell within a shell‚Äô forms the basis of Geha‚Äôs concept of viewing another world from the inside, the outer shell‚Äîraw with damaged walls‚Äîremains visible, an integral part of the destination where guests socialise in a chill out bar.
‚ÄúThe concept is about offering the club goers an immersive experience within an interior shell created to envelope the crowd, all the while still filtering out to the outside via the mesh,‚Äù explains the architect, ‚Äúit creates a sense of discharge. The path to the main space, which is the outside bar, is one of discovery, forming a palette of experiences before entering it.‚Äù Based on the notion of containment without caging, RG/Architects worked closely with the team at Addmind Group; the client well-respected for their innovative approach to nightlife.
As visitors move around the shell, they switch between luxurious and industrial interiors, linear light elements encouraging playful interaction and movement without limits. Renowned for their use of light, Geha‚Äôs practice set the mood dial to semi-dystopian futurism, completing an immersive experience for Beirut style-conscious ravers.
